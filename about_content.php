                    <p class="lead text-muted">La Casa de Ceramica sells ceramics designed using unique materials such as mussel shells, sea shells, oyster shells, etc. which are often thrown away.</p>
                    <p class="text-left">The business aims to achieve high-quality products produced by top-notch companies such as Eurotiles Industrial Corporation and Mariwasa Uncompromising Quality. Unlike other companies, the entrepreneurs ensure that the products are inexpensive and promote a healthier environment by not using products that could endanger the environment.</p>
                    <p>The main purpose of the business is to save the ocean, together with the sea creatures living in it. The whole theme of the products revolves around saving marine life and preserving the natural resources that are often destroyed by many businesses and organizations in exchange for their own profit and gain. The proponents also aim to bring the ocean closer to people.</p>
                    <p>In addition to that, the business aspires to give opportunities to the pottery makers and to the unemployed, especially in this time of pandemic, by offering them to be a part of the business. This is possible through creating a connection between pottery makers and ceramicists that gives a new mode of communication and share ideas through this business. The uniqueness of the ceramics offered by this business is the materials used in order to create the outputs. Some seafood with shells is often thrown away, so the entrepreneurs thought of an alternative way to give another purpose onto this, like making it a design or decoration in houses. The products in La Casa de Ceramica have numerous benefits: they are lightweight, non-flammable, and have excellent durability. The business aims to satisfy those people needing a safer, new, and millennial look for their specific ambiance of their houses.</p>
                    <p>La Casa de Ceramica is aiming to target the people who love to grow small plants or just want a decor piece in their rooms or anywhere in their houses, as well as those who are interested in ocean-themed products. 'Plantita/tito', 'plantmom/dad', parents, aunts, and grandparents are the main targets of these ceramic products to make their house more beautiful or their garden. La Casa de Ceramica excels in the designs and quality of the clay they use. The business also aims to provide their market with products that best suit the atmosphere of their homes.</p>
